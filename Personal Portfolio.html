              <p class="bio-text">Sam Collins was born in 1996 in Hong Kong to Stephen and Anita Collins, 
                <br>before relocating to Jordan at age two where the "made in China" jokes 
                <br>flowed plentifully from his classmates. He finished his high-school education
                <br>in Burlington, North Carolina before attending UNC Wilmington in 2014.
                <br>After graduating, he worked in videography and editing until shifting his career
                <br>direction to programming, currently studying software engineering at Coding Temple.
                <br>His interest in computers can be found in his self-built desktop, or in his 
                <br>2014 Macbook that he managed to keep alive until 2023 when it mysteriously crashed
                <br>before he backed-up its harddrive. Miraculously, he managed to get through this 
                <br>without a stint in a straight-jacket, and has since switched to Asus.

    <p class="shawarma-text">Fifteen years in Jordan convinced Sam that shawarma was the greatest dish ever invented by mankind. 
        <br>Unfortunately, the options for quality shawarma in the U.S. proved sparse and the one Jordanian restaurant in Burlington closed down.
       <br> After many sleepless nights of trial-and-error, he finally developed what he believes to be the best shawarma recipe west of Amman:
    </p>
        <p class="recipe">
        5 lbs chicken breast
        <br>8 tablespoons olive oil
        <br>1 tablespoon garlic
        <br>2 tsp lemon & pepper
        <br>2 tbs lemon juice
        <br>2 tsp thyme
        <br>3 tsp coriander
        <br>3 tsp cumin
        <br>2 tsp nutmeg
        <br>2 tsp ground ginger
        <br>2 tsp turmeric
        <br>2 tsp cayenne powder
        <br>2 tsp cinnamon
        <br>2 tsp paprika
        <br>black pepper
        <br>2 tsp salt
        <br>1 tsp cardamom
        <br>1.5 tsp allspice
        </p>
    <p class="instructions">Slice chicken thin, marinate in all of the above overnight.
        <br>Cook in airfryer at 400 degrees for 45 minutes,
        <br>flipping the chicken every 15 minutes,
        <br>or pan-fry at medium-high in olive oil. 
        <br>Mix 1/2 cup of mayo with 1/2 cup of sourcream. 
        <br>Spread on tortilla bread (buy the thinnest you can find),
        <br>along with sliced dill pickle spears.
        <br> Add chicken. Wrap the tortilla. 
        <br>Pan sear all sides for crispiness. 
        <br>Enjoy with fries and something carbonated.
